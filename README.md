# Derick's Dotfiles
This repository contains my dotfiles. I plan on merging this into my old dotfiles repository eventually and just re-versioning the old one.

## Requirements
Git, to download this repository. I'm trying to automate as much as I can, including the homebrew installation.

## Installation
1. Manually run scripts in install folder based on architecure.
    * For macOS, after running homebrew script run `brew bundle`.
